# ðŸš€ ESP32 Projects with ESP-IDF

This repository contains my collection of **ESP32 projects and examples** developed using [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf).  
The goal is to build a structured learning and experimentation hub covering **embedded systems, IoT, networking, cryptography, and security** on the ESP32 platform.
